	<p>Math 340 Introduction to linear programming: Monday Wednesday Friday 12pm-1pm in BUCH A201. <a href="340outline.pdf">Outline</a> of the course.<p/>
	
	<p>Office hours are: Wednesday 1pm-2pm in MATH 105 and Thursday 4:30pm-5:30pm in MATHX 1118.<p/>
	

	<h2>Lecture notes</h2>
	
	<p>The instructor in charge is <a href = "https://www.math.ubc.ca/~anstee/">Richard Anstee</a>, he posts lecture notes, practice quizzes, and more <a href = "https://www.math.ubc.ca/~anstee/math340/math340.html">here</a>. In particular, you can find <a href = "https://www.math.ubc.ca/~anstee/math340/340lptheorems.pdf">in this document</a> the theorems about LP and duality that you need to know.</p>
	
	<p>In addition to Anstee's lecture notes, you can find below additional material.</p>

		<li><a href = "pivoting_process.pdf">How to perform a pivot?</a>.</li>
		
		<li><a href = "two_phase_method.pdf">The Two Phase method</a>.</li>
		
		<li><a href = "theory_simplex.pdf">Why does the simplex algorithm work?</a>.</li>

	<h2>Day to day info</h2>

	<ul> 
	
		<li>01/06. Example of the soldiers' diet (more historical information can be found for instance <a href ="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-68874-4_4.pdf">here</a>) and outline of the course. The software LINDO can be downloaded at <a href = "https://www.lindo.com/index.php/ls-downloads">this adress</a>.</li>
	
		<li>01/08. "Big data" example with some reminder of Linear algebra. The equivalence between the linear and non-linear problems will be treated more carefully next lecture.</li>
		
		<li>01/10. End of the big data example. Definition of LP, LP in standard (inequality) form and how to put a LP in standard inequality form. You will be tested on the latter in quizz 1 (practice quizzes are available on Richard Anstee's website).</li>
		
		<li>01/13. How to put a LP in standard inequality form, continued. Definition of the slack variables and of a dictionary. Example of a pivot to optimality.</li>
		
		<li>01/15. Class is cancelled. Teaching hours are cancelled. You can find <a href = "pivoting_process.pdf">in this pdf</a> a detailed example of the pivot's method with practice examples. I also remind you that lecture notes and practice quizzes are availbe on <a href = "https://www.math.ubc.ca/~anstee/math340/math340.html">the webpage</a> of the other section.</li>
		
		<li>01/17. Another pivot to optimality and discussion of why optimality is reached. First quiz (about how to put a LP in standard form and the pivoting process), note that there were 4 different versions of the quiz.</li>
	
		<li>01/20. Two Phase Method and first example of degeneracy. We will talk about unbounded and infeasible LPs on Wednesday. See also this <a href = "two_phase_method.pdf">flowchart of the Two Phase method with examples</a>.</li>
		
		<li>01/22. Example of an infeasible LP and example of a unbounded LP.</li>
		
		<li>01/24. Discussion about why the simplex method works, see <a href = "theory_simplex.pdf">the slides</a> of the lecture. Remarks about the finiteness of the number of dictionaries, as well as degeneracy and cycling. Second quiz about the Two Phase method.</li>
		
		<li>01/27. Motivation for the duality theory following the example of the textbook. Dual of a LP in standard inequality form.</li>
		
		<li>01/29. Weak duality and the consequence for checking optimality. Complementary slackness. The example I did at the end of the class is treated in details <a href = "example_complementary_slackness.pdf">in this pdf</a>.</li>
		
		<li>01/31. <a href = "20340asst1.pdf">First assignment</a> due (<a href = "20340asst1sol.pdf">Solution</a>). End of the example on complementary slackness. Statement of the theorem on strong duality. Revised simplex formulas and their proof, summarized in <a href = "revised_simplex_formula.pdf">in this pdf</a>.</li>
	
		<li>02/03. Additional comments on the proof of the revised simplex formulas. Proof of the strong duality theorem.</li>
