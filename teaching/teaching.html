		<h2>Bocconi University</h2>
	
		<p>I am or have been teaching: 
			<ul> 
				<li>Mathematical Analysis 2 (Spring 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024): analysis for 1st year undegraduate students. </li>				
				<li>Real Analysis I (Fall 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023): a.k.a. measure theory for 1st year PhD students.</li>
				<li>Advanced Analysis and Optimization 1 (Fall 2022, with Federico Vegni): ODEs 2nd year undegraduate students. </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	
		<h2>UBC</h2>
		
		<p>As a postdoctoral fellow, I have taught: 
			<ul> 
				<li>Math 340 (January-April 2020): Introduction to linear programming.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	
	
		<h2>IUT Orsay</h2>
		
		<p>During my PhD, I was a teaching assistant in mathematics to first and second year students in IUT Orsay, an engineering school. I taught calculus, linear algebra, algorithmic and computer science, and statistics.
		</p>
	
		<h2>Lycée Louis-Le-Grand</h2>
	
		<p>Between 2013 and 2016 I gave weekly oral examinations in mathematics to students in <em>classes préparatoires</em>. Here are the <a href = "exercices_15_16.pdf">statements</a> and the <a href = "exercices_15_16c.pdf">solutions</a> of the exercices I gave in 2015-2016 (in French).</p>
		
		<h2>Lecture notes on opinion propagation</h2>
	
		</p>With <a href = "https://www.math.u-psud.fr/~maury/">Bertrand Maury</a>, we wrote <a href = "https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02396687/document">lecture notes</a> about mathematical models describing opinion propagation over social networks. They are accessible at an undergraduate level and revisit some classical results of linear algebra, matrix theory or Markov chain with a new standpoint. <p>
